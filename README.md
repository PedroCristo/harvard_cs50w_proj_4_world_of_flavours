## Distinctiveness and Complexity
World of Flavors is my final project after several months of learning and improving my skills in Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more in the world of web development. I decided to build a food recipe website because I thought it would be a fun and challenging project. This project is a recipe management system with features like user authentication, posting recipes, liking and unliking recipes, rating them, and leaving comments. The complexity of the project comes from its detailed user profile management, a wide range of recipe categories, and dynamic content display. The site is designed to be responsive, providing a smooth experience on any device. Additionally, Djangoâ€™s custom user models and a comprehensive admin panel for managing content further add to its complexity.

Along the way, I faced challenges, particularly with building the views and passing data to the templates. I also ran into issues with the database, which required me to reset it and start posting recipes again. However, after dedicating a few weeks to the project, I was able to complete it. In my opinion, it is functioning well, and the performance is solid.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/me50/PedroCristo
    cd cs50sw_project_5_world_of_flavors
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Apply database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

6. **Access the application in your browser:**

    Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

## Design

## Colours

![Colour Palette](./media/images/assets/readme/world_flavors_color_palete.jpg)<br>

- The colour scheme is designed to enhance readability and user experience. The primary background color is white, providing a clean and minimalistic look, while text appears in black for high contrast and legibility. For the navigation bar, a white background is used which transitions to a slightly darker shade of black when the user scrolls, creating a subtle effect. Icons, some buttons, and text are displayed using the interactive color (orange) to make them stand out and engage users.

- Here are the specific colors used in the design:
  - **White Color**: `rgb(247, 236, 236)`
  - **Light Grey Color**: `rgb(204, 194, 194)`
  - **Dark Black**: `rgb(37, 35, 35)`
  - **Light Black**: `rgb(70, 68, 68)`
  - **Interactive Color**: `rgb(255, 166, 0)`
  - **Error Red Color**: `rgb(230, 82, 82)`

## Typography

- The Montserrat font is used as the main font for the whole project, and the Kaushan font is used to display the recipe names.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

```
<!-- SEO -->
<meta name="description" content="Explore a world of diverse and delicious recipes with World of Flavors. From international dishes to local favorites, discover and rate recipes for every taste. Join our community to share culinary experiences and enjoy new flavor adventures. Free sign-up and special features for all users.">
<meta name="keywords" content="recipes, recipe ratings, global cuisines, cooking inspiration, flavor adventures, culinary reviews, food enthusiasts, international recipes, user reviews, cooking community, diverse dishes, recipe sharing, flavor exploration, taste experiences">
```

To help people find World of Flavors more easily once it's deployed live, I have added important SEO practices, including meta tags in the `<head>`section of the project. This will ensure that search engines can find and display our site in search results.

## Features

- **UserProfile Model**: Stores additional user information such as a profile picture, social media links, and bio.

```python
class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user_name = models.CharField(max_length=30, blank=True)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=30, blank=True)
    user_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/profile_images/', blank=True, null=True)
    user_social_media = models.URLField(max_length=200, blank=True)
    bio = models.TextField(max_length=500, blank=True)
```

### Recipes App Models

- **MainCategory Model**: Represents the primary categories that recipes can be classified under.

- **OriginCategory Model**: Represents the origin or type of cuisine for the recipe.

- **Recipe Model**: Manages the core content of the site â€” the recipes, including title, ingredients, preparation steps, and images.

- **Rating Model**: Allows users to rate recipes and ensures that each user can only rate a recipe once.

- **Comment Model**: Handles user comments on recipes, with moderation controls (`is_approved`, `is_active`).

```python
class Recipe(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=False)
    sub_title = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=False)
    ingredients = models.TextField()

## Website Responsiveness

### The website is designed to be fully responsive across a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This ensures that users have an optimal viewing experience no matter what device they use. Hereâ€™s how the website adapts to different screen sizes:

### Tablet

- For tablet users, the website adjusts to a more compact layout. The navigation bar switches to a more mobile-friendly format, and the content is presented in a single-column format to fit the narrower screen width. Interactive elements and images are resized to ensure they remain functional and visually appealing.

### Mobile

- For mobile users, the website adapts to an even more compact layout. The navigation bar becomes a collapsible menu for easier access, and content is streamlined into a single-column view to accommodate the smaller screen size. Interactive elements and images are resized and optimized to ensure they remain functional and visually appealing on the reduced display

## Testing

### Continuous Testing and Quality Checking

Throughout the development of this project, rigorous testing was an integral part of the process to ensure the website's functionality, responsiveness, and overall user experience met the project's goals.

Each view of the website was subjected to regular and systematic testing. This included checking the layout, design elements, and interactive features to ensure they performed consistently across different devices and browsers. Special attention was given to ensuring that the website maintained its integrity and visual appeal on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

#### Debugging and Issue Resolution

Whenever the outcome of a test did not align with the expected results, immediate debugging was initiated. This involved identifying the root cause of the issue, whether it was related to front-end design, back-end logic, or cross-browser compatibility (Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge).
